There are 3 main places data can come from in HTTP:

1️⃣ Path parameter

/users/5


2️⃣ Query parameter

/users?id=5


3️⃣ Request body

POST with JSON

# swagger 
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs


# curl to send the post request 
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/data" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Sir","age":20}'
